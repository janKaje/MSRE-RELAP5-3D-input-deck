# RELAP5-3D Input Deck for the MSRE

This was a semester-long project undertaken by myself, Jacob Purser, and Spencer Jensen. This repository includes the final report and the three input decks used to create the final model.

The MSRE (Molten Salt Reactor Experiment) was the first land-based molten salt nuclear reactor. RELAP5-3D is a research program used to model a nuclear power plant in order to analyze its safety.

Our chosen transient is a LOFA (Loss Of Flow Analysis) wherein the main fuel pump loses electrical power. Our results demonstrate that despite this, the reactor maintains integrity and poses no risk to the health, safety, or welfare of the employees or the general public.

Although RELAP5-3D's code is export-controlled, there is no restriction that we are aware of regarding the distribution of input decks.
